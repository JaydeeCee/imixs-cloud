# Ingress Configuration with Traefik.io

In general services running in a kubernetes cluster are not visible from outside your cluster or the Internet. To gain access to a service running inside your cluster from the Internet, you need a so called [Ingress Network](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).   

_Imixs-Cloud_  provides you with a ready to use Ingress Configuration based on [Traefik.io](http://traefik.io) in combination with the ACME provider [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). This makes it easy to publish services to the Internet in a secure way. 

The following section describe the setup of the Traefik.io configuration for  _Imixs-Cloud_ .Traefik.io provides a lot of features to route traefik from outside into a specific services running within your Kubernetes cluster. You will find detailed information how to configure traefik.io in the [official documentation](https://docs.traefik.io/)

		

## Configuration

The traefik setup of  _Imixs-Cloud_  consists of a set of resource yaml files which can be customized and extended.

 - 010-crd_rbac.yaml - defines the custom resources and roles needed by Traefik.io
 - 011-persistencevolume.yaml - optional file to store the Let's Encrypt acme.json file
 - 020-deployment.yaml - defines the Traefik.io deployment object including the Let's Encrypt configuration and middleware components
 - 030-ingress.yml - optional definition for a ingress to the dashboard

### The Deployment Configuration

The file *020-deployment.yaml* contains the deployment configuration for Traefik.io and also the ACME provider [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Before your apply the Traefik.io configuration to your cluster, first edit this file.
 
The spec defines a external IP address which is used to route external requests to one cluster node. Traffic that ingresses into the cluster with the external IP (as destination IP), on the Service port, will be routed to one of the Service endpoints. External IPs are not managed by Kubernetes and are the responsibility of the cluster administrator. Find more details [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#external-ips).

Replace the *{MASTER-NODE-IP}* with the Node IP address of one of your kubernetes cluster nodes used to ingress external traefik. This should typically be the IP address from your master node.
 
	spec:
	  externalIPs:
	  - {MASTER-NODE-IP} 
 
#### Let's Encrypt 
 
For the Let's Encrypt setup replace the place holder _{YOUR-E-MAIL}_ with the e-mail address of your organization.

        # comment staging server for production
        - --certificatesresolvers.default.acme.caserver=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        - --certificatesresolvers.default.acme.email={YOUR-E-MAIL}

##### The Staging Server        

For testing the ACME provider runs in the default configuration on a staging server.

	https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

You can delete or comment the property *certificatesresolvers.default.acme.caserver* from the Let's Encrypt setup section after you have tested your cluster setup. 

        # comment or delete the staging server for production
        #- --certificatesresolvers.default.acme.caserver=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
	

The staging setup is used to test the creation of certificates but it is not requesting real ones. It is recommended that you first test your configuration via the staging server. If you are sure that everything works fine you can delete or comment the line defining the staging server.

Letâ€™s Encrypt provides rate limits to register domains. If you register more than 50 domains per week - which can happen during testing - your server will be blocked for one week. Find details about the rate limits [here](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/)

Optional you can install a durable persistence volume to store the acme.json file. You need to create a longhorn data volume and uncomment the volumeMounts in the *020-deployment.yaml*. Than you can apply the optional *011-persistencevolume.yaml* file. Find details [here](../management/traefik/README.md).

##### Testing the acme.json File

You can verify your configuration and test if certificates are generated by inspecting the file *acme.json*. Just ssh into your traefik container and run:

	$ cat /var/lib/traefik/acme.json  

You should see sections for each of your public internet domain name in this file. For example enries like this:


     .......
       "Store": "default"
      },
      {
        "domain": {
          "main": "whoami.foo.com"
        },
        "certificate": "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0t......
     .....

If these sections are not generated check the log files form your traefik container. 

If everything looks good, than you can delete the acme.json file from your container and restart traefik without the staging certificate server. Traefik will now request real Let's-Encrypt certificates. Again you can verify the certificates by exaiming the acme.json file in your container.





### The Traefik Web Dashboard

In the file file *020-deployment.yaml* the 'insecure' mode is set to true per default. This means you can open the Traefik.io Web Dashboard from your master node on Port 8100.

        - --api.insecure=false

After testing you should disable the insecure mode and configure a Ingress Network as explained in the  [Security](SECURITY.md) section. The file _030-ingress.yaml_ provides you with a template. Replace the place holder *{YOUR-HOST-NAME}* with the internet name for your traefik dashboard. 

	  
## Deployment
	  
After you have configured the resource yaml files you can apply setup traefik into your kubernetes cluster.

First create the Customer Resource objects and roles:

	$ kubectl create -f management/traefik/010-crd_rbac.yaml
	
Next you can deploy traefik:

	$ kubectl apply -f management/traefik/020-deployment.yaml


You can access the Traefik.io dashboard now in the insecure mode

	http://{MASTER-NODE-IP}:8100

**Note:** You can disable the dashboard in the 020-deployment.yaml file if you set
  
    - --api.dashboard=false

For the ingress configuration edit the file 030-ingress.yaml and apply your configuration with:

	$ kubectl apply -f management/traefik/030-ingress.yaml

You can than access the traefik dashboard from 

	http://{YOUR-TRAEFIK-HOST-NAME} 



## Ingress 

Now as you have deployed Traefik.io into your cluster you can define your own Ingress within  your POD to gain access from the Internet.
The following example shows a simple Ingress configuration 


	kind: Ingress
	apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
	metadata:
	  name: myingress
	spec:
	  rules:
	  - host: example.foo.com
	    http:
	      paths:
	      - path: /
	        backend:
	          serviceName: whoami
	          servicePort: 80

HTTP requests will be automatically forwarded to HTTPS and a Let's Encrypt configuration will be requested by traefik. 

To test your traefik setup you can deploy the 'whoami' service which is part of the _/apps/_ .
Edit the file /apps/whoami/030-ingress.yaml and apply your configuration:

	$ kubectl apply -f whoami/

You can control your ingress configuration from the Traefik.io web ui:

## Middleware

With the concept of [middlewares](https://docs.traefik.io/routing/routers/#middlewares) you can refine the routing of a ingress rule. 
For example you can add a basic authentication to secure your service. 

<img src="images/traefik-ui-middleware.png" />


The file *020-deployment.yaml* contains optional middleware configurations. This configuration is be used for example to secure services (e.g. the Traefik Web Dashboard) with a basic authentication. 


### Adding Basic Authentication

The [Middleware BasicAuth](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/basicauth/) is a quick way to restrict access to your services to known users. 
The middleware can be configured with a list of user/password pairs. 


#### 1. Generate a password file

First generate a password file on your master node with your user:password pairs. You can use the commadline tool 'htpasswd' which is part of the apache2-utils.
The following command will add a new user:password pair to a local stored password file named '.kubepasswd'

	$ htpasswd -nb admin adminadmin >> .kubepasswd
	$ htpasswd -nb user password >> .kubepasswd

In kubernetes a user:password string must be base64-encoded. To create an encoded user:password pairs from your password file run the following command:


	$ cat .kubepasswd | openssl base64
	YWRtaW46JGFwcjEkWXdmLkF6Um0kc3owTkpQMi55cy56V2svek43aENtLwoKdXNl
	cjokYXByMSRaU2VKQW1pOSRVV1AvcDdsQy9KSzdrbXBIMXdGL28uCgo=

The output is needed for the traefik middleware configuration.

#### 2. Define a Traefik Middleware

The following middleware definition creates a basic authentication layer in the file admin-auth.yaml:

	apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
	kind: Middleware
	metadata:
	  name: basic-auth
	spec:
	  basicAuth:
	    secret: authsecret
	
	---
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Secret
	metadata:
	  name: authsecret
	  namespace: default
	data:
	  users: |2
	    YWRtaW46JGFwcjEkWXdmLkF6Um0kc3owTkpQMi55cy56V2svek43aENtLwoKdXNl
	    cjokYXByMSRaU2VKQW1pOSRVV1AvcDdsQy9KSzdrbXBIMXdGL28uCgo=

Below the section data.users paste your own encoded user password file content.  
  
Apply your new basicAuth middleware with:

	$ kubectl apply -f admin-auth.yaml



#### 3. Secure a Service with Basic Authentication

To apply the baicAuth middleware you just need to add the annotation in your ingress objects:


	kind: Ingress
	apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
	metadata:
	  name: myingress
	  annotations:
	    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.middlewares: default-basic-auth@kubernetescrd
    ....


**Note:** the name of the middelware need to be praefixed with 'default-' and suffixed with '@kubernetescrd' 



### HTTP to HTTPS Redirectscheme

The [Middleware RedirectScheme](https://docs.traefik.io/middlewares/redirectscheme/) can be used for a redirection from HTTP to HTTPS. By the default configuration this is not needed if you have the following traefik api setting in your deployment

        - --entrypoints.web.http.redirections.entryPoint.to=websecure

This setting enables a permanent redirecting of all requests on http (80) to https (443) managed by traefik internally.

If for some reasons you can not use the internal http-https redirect, you can also define a separate middleware configuration:


	# Redirect http -> https
	---
	apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
	kind: Middleware
	metadata:
	  name: https-redirect
	spec:
	  redirectScheme:
	    scheme: https
	    permanent: true
	    port: 443
	    
To use this middleware in a ingress configuration use the treafik annotations like in the following example:


	kind: Ingress
	apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
	metadata:
	  name: ...
	  annotations:
	    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: websecure
	spec:
	  rules:
	  - host:......
  


## Entrypoints

In Imixs-Cloud traefik is the default ingress router. For some configuration it may be needed to define custom entry points for your ingress provided by your services. In this case you can use the traefik annotation *router.entrypoints*:

	kind: Ingress
	apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
	metadata:
	  name: myingress
	  # optional set explicit entrypoints
	  annotations:
	    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: web, websecure
	spec:
	  rules:
	  - host: example.foo.com
	    http:
	      paths:
	      - path: /
	        backend:
	          serviceName: whoami
	          servicePort: 80	    


## IngressRoute

IngresRoute is a specific object defined by traefik. In general you can use kubernetes ingress objects as explained in the section above. But of course you can use also the traefik specific IngressRoute object to define an Ingress if needed. Within the general traefik setup we activated both - the kubernetes-crd provider and the kuberntes-ingress provider.

You can find more about traefik ingressRoute objects [here](https://docs.traefik.io/providers/kubernetes-crd/) 

See the following example defining a traefik Ingres Route for a service:


	# IngresRoute http
	---
	kind: IngressRoute
	apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
	metadata:
	  name: whoami-notls
	  namespace: default
	
	spec:
	  entryPoints: 
	    - web
	  routes:
	  - match: Host(`example.foo.com`) 
	    kind: Rule
	    services:
	    - name: whoami
	      port: 80
	    # add basic auth
	    #middlewares: 
	    #- name: basic-auth
